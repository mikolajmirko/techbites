# TechBites

TechBites is a web portal designed from scratch that brings people interested in usability & accessibility together. On the website, you can find bites ‚Äì short and easy to digest portions of information on various topics in the field of UI/UX. It was designed, implemented and deployed as part of my Master's thesis project. You can see the live version on üåê https://techbites.pl/. 

This repository is a main Wordpress theme for the site. It's based on [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) - a starter theme with a modern development workflow. Below is a small summary of used technologies.

## Summary

* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for stylesheets + modern JavaScript
